I am a veteran Python user who started using Python in the mid-1990s. I never imagined back then that it would become a nearly 30-year relationship. However, from the moment I first encountered it, I felt that “this programming language is useful.” I created a Japanese mailing list for information exchange and started a documentation translation project. Additionally, during that time, Python did not work properly on Japanese Windows environments, so I developed a Japanese patch version.
Originally, my main work was in C/C++, and I didn’t use Python that much. However, the ratio of Python in my work gradually increased, and now I am almost exclusively working with Python.
